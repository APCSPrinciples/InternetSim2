Then you and a partner must develop a protocol which will allow you to send any image you might create on your grid, paying particular attention to how many bits are used to represent each binary number. You [this activity guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yoXIBpv1qjhMEBUqxvmVOERRgcGoQ_0dXfho3sDWgg8/edit) to describe your protocol and answer some questions.
 
Log on to the [code.org internet simulator](https://studio.code.org/s/csp1/stage/6/puzzle/2) and try out your protocol. To test your protocol you will given a test-image to transmit.
